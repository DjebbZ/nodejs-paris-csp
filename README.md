## Introduction to CSP in Javascript

Repo that accompanies the talk given at Node.js Paris on May, 20th 2015

### Install

`git clone git@github.com:DjebbZ/nodejs-paris-csp.git`
`npm install`

### Usage

1. Run `npm run build` and browse the file `index.html` to see the result.
2. Read the code
3. To hack it, there's a watcher available that rebuilds the javascript on each file save. To run it, `npm run watch`

### Resources

There's very few material about channels/csp in Javascript, but you can find a lot in the Go language and Clojure/ClojureScript (core.async). Favor the resources from Clojure since js-csp is ported from it.

The images I've shown during the meetup are in [this article](http://www.goinggo.net/2014/02/the-nature-of-channels-in-go.html)
